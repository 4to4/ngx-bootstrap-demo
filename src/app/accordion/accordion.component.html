        (accordion) Lorem Ipsum:

            <b> Why do we use it? </b>
            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
            letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many
            desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved
            over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

            You can block the memcached port in your firewall and allow access only from the database server which is
            already be enough. Memcachedâ€™s default port is widely considered to be 11211 (TCP). The easiest example is
            via iptables assuming that 8.8.8.8 would be our server (which is not) so you have to edit this example
            accordingly.
            iptables -A INPUT -s !8.8.8.8/0 -p tcp --destination-port 11211 -j DROP
            You can archive similar prevention with every other NAT based firewall too.
